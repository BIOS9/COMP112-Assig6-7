Questions for Reflection.
=========================

1. Briefly list the features that you implemented in your Chat Client.


2. Describe how you tested your program, and discuss how much confidence you have
that your testing shows that the program works correctly. 


Answers for Reflection.
========================

* Asynchronous callback architecture
* Separate tabs for different private chats and server
* GUI window to enter username, nickname and realname
* Quick access buttons on the side of the window for basic commands
* List window that opens when server sends a channel list, and displays the channels with the users
* Window to ask for nickname for private message or channel name for channel joining
* Coloured text formatting
* Command manager for easy implementation handling commands from both the server and client
* Prints errors to window so they can be easily viewed.


I tested my program by connecting to and using the "irc.ecs.vuw.ac.nz" IRC server. I ran through many different actions such as:
* messaging individual users
* messaging channels
* messaging non existant users
* Reading messages from ChatBot both in private messages and in #112Test
* Sending general commands like LIST, MOTD, HELP, JOIN, PART, INFO, PRIVMSG

I am not confident in the testing of my program because the program got large enough that there were too many parts to efficiently test it in the given time.

If I wanted to be confident in the testing of my program, I would have to test each feature fully whenever I changed something, because changing one thing can have unforseen consequences on other things. This could be done with a larger team, more time, or some form of automated testing.

It would also improve testing if I was testing the program on a test IRC server that I have control over. This would allow me to check how the client handles invalid data, automate testing, and artifically generate many different errors or server replies.
